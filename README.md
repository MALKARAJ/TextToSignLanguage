# TextToSignLanguage
A translator from English text to Sign Language video.

A simple module to translate text to videos of people signing the literal translation of each word summed up in to one big video.

USAGE:
After cloning the repository you should update all path variables to suit your machine.
Next , run the application. You should input a text and guide the program - every time the program encounters a word it does not currently have in the database it will request to download it from the internet, so you will need an internet connection. The download may prompt user approval so save the file to your downloads and all should work well.

As you will see videos are put together by concatenating videos showing each sign. You may alter these and create videos of yourself.

Currently supports PSE only.

Have fun!
